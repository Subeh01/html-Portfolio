<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, <br/>
  My name is Shubham Bafna, I am a salesprofessional , learning to code and make a career in this field.

<p>
  I am going to focus my efforts in creating a travel & Photography website for my projects.

</p>

<P> I have been doing odd jobs to keep traveling and till now I have covered a wide range of Indian destinations, but i stay hungry for more.</P>

<p>Apart from travel, I like to Swim, Climb, Read and watch Movies. I am a connoisseur of great cinematic experiences, I am a big fan of El Pachino.</p>

Thanks for visiting !
